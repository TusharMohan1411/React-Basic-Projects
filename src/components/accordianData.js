        question: "What is the square root of 64?",
        answer: "The square root of 64 is 8. This is because 8 multiplied by itself (8 x 8) equals 64. In mathematics, the square root of a number is a value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. The concept of square roots is fundamental in various areas of mathematics, including algebra and geometry. The symbol for the square root is √, so the square root of 64 can also be written as √64. Understanding square roots is essential for solving quadratic equations and for understanding more advanced mathematical concepts."

        question: "What is the chemical symbol for water?",
        answer: "The chemical symbol for water is H2O. This notation indicates that a water molecule is composed of two hydrogen atoms (H2) bonded to one oxygen atom (O). Water is a vital substance for all known forms of life and covers about 71% of the Earth's surface. It exists in three states: liquid, solid (ice), and gas (water vapor). Water is essential for numerous biological processes, including digestion, cellular respiration, and temperature regulation. Its unique properties, such as high specific heat and surface tension, are due to the hydrogen bonding between water molecules."
